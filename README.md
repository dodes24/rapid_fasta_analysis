# Rapid_Fasta_Analysis

A tool created for the UCT course.

* This is a simple tool to analyze a fasta file. It is useful to find the number of sequences in a fasta file
    and to find the length of the longest sequence. It is also useful to find the number of sequences with a
    given length.

## Main features
* Process a fasta file. It can be a single sequence or a multiple sequence file. 
* Obtain description of a sequence.
* Return subsequence of a sequence.
* Counting nucleotides in a sequence.
* Computing the GC content of a sequence.
* Computing the melting temperature of a sequence.
* Complementing a strand of DNA.
* DNA to RNA conversion.
* RNA to DNA conversion.
